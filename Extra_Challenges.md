### **🔹 Challenge 1: Turn Doodles into Realistic Images**
🎨 **Task:** Train a **CycleGAN** to turn simple hand-drawn sketches into realistic images.  
- Use a dataset like **Sketch2Photo** or create your own using simple black-and-white drawings.  
- Train a **CycleGAN** to map **sketches → realistic images** (like faces, cats, or landscapes).  

🔹 **Hints:**  
- Use **Pix2Pix** or **CycleGAN** models from PyTorch or TensorFlow.  
- You can get pre-trained CycleGAN models and fine-tune them.  
- Try **turning your own doodles into real-looking photos!**  

📌 **Bonus:** Can you make an app where users upload a sketch and the GAN converts it to a realistic version?

### **🔹 Challenge 2: Improve GAN Training with Data Augmentation**
🚀 **Task:** Modify the GAN training process to use **data augmentation** on real images.  
- Apply transformations like **flipping, rotation, and noise injection** to real images before training.  
- This should make the Discriminator **more robust** and improve GAN performance.  

🔹 **Hints:**  
- Use `torchvision.transforms` in PyTorch to apply **random rotations and flips**.  
- Monitor how **data augmentation affects Generator output** (e.g., better diversity, fewer artifacts).  
- Compare the **loss curves** between GANs trained with and without augmentation.  

📌 **Bonus:** Can you write a report comparing different augmentation strategies?

### **🔹 Challenge 3: Make a “Style Transfer GAN” (Deep Dream Style)**
🖼 **Task:** Train a GAN that **learns the style of one painting** and applies it to other images.  
- For example, transfer **Van Gogh's Starry Night style** onto real photos.  
- Use a dataset of famous paintings or artistic textures.  

🔹 **Hints:**  
- Use **StyleGAN** or **Neural Style Transfer (NST)** to achieve this effect.  
- Try blending multiple styles together (e.g., **Starry Night + Picasso!**).  
- Experiment with different datasets (e.g., nature photos, anime styles, or famous paintings).  

📌 **Bonus:** Can you **make it interactive** so users can upload their own images and apply styles?

### **🔹 Challenge 4: Train a GAN to Generate Anime Faces**
🎭 **Task:** Train a GAN **on anime faces** instead of real human faces!  
- Use the **Anime Faces Dataset** and train a GAN to generate **new anime characters**.  

🔹 **Hints:**  
- Use **StyleGAN** or a **DCGAN** architecture.  
- Experiment with different architectures to **improve quality**.  
- Save samples every few epochs to see how anime characters evolve!  

📌 **Bonus:** Can you train a GAN to **generate anime characters based on text prompts**? (e.g., "blonde hair, red eyes, smiling")  

---

### **🔹 Challenge 5: Generate Fake Human Faces (Deepfake-Level!)**
🕵️ **Task:** Train a **realistic GAN** to generate **fake human faces** that look real.  
- Use a dataset like **CelebA** (celebrity faces) or **FFHQ** (high-quality human faces).  
- Train **StyleGAN** or **Progressive GAN** to generate photorealistic people.  

🔹 **Hints:**  
- Use **StyleGAN** from NVIDIA, which creates **hyper-realistic faces**.  
- Experiment with **different hyperparameters** (learning rate, training time, etc.).  
- Try to **edit specific features** like age, hair color, and expressions.  

📌 **Bonus:** Can you make a **web app** where users generate random human faces?  

---

### **🔹 Challenge 6: Create a Text-to-Image GAN (AI That Paints!)**
📝 **Task:** Train a **text-to-image GAN** that generates images from **text descriptions**.  
- Example: Input **"A cat sitting on a beach"**, and the GAN **generates that image**!  
- Use **DeepAI’s Text-to-Image model** or **AttnGAN (Attention GAN)** for this.  

🔹 **Hints:**  
- Train the GAN using a dataset of **captions + images**.  
- Use **CLIP** from OpenAI to help the GAN understand text better.  
- Experiment with different architectures (e.g., **BigGAN + CLIP**).  

📌 **Bonus:** Can you make a **story generator where users write a sentence, and the GAN generates an image per sentence?**  

---

### **🚀 Final Super Challenge: Build Your Own Unique GAN Application!**
🤖 **Task:** Think of a **creative GAN idea** and build a **small project** around it!  
- Could be **AI-generated clothing designs, 3D objects, surreal dreamscapes, or AI comic book panels**.  
- Combine **different GANs** for a more advanced project.  

📌 **Example Ideas:**  
✔️ A **GAN that generates dream-like landscapes** ☁️🏞  
✔️ A **GAN that turns photos into pixel art or LEGO-style** 🎮🧱  
✔️ A **GAN that generates sci-fi book covers** 📚🚀  

📌 **Bonus:** Can you **make a small website or app** where people interact with your GAN creation?  

---
