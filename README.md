# GAN Challenges & Solutions 🎨🤖

Welcome to the **GAN Challenges & Solutions** repository! This repository is designed to help you learn and implement **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** through a series of hands-on coding exercises, extra challenges, and step-by-step solutions. 🚀

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **`lesson.md`** → Introduction to GANs and the key concepts covered in the exercises.
- **`explanation.md`** → A deep dive into how GANs work, with simple-to-follow explanations.
- **`Extra_Challenges.md`** → Advanced GAN challenges for those who want to take their skills further.
- **`Gan Challenges Solutions.md`** → Full working solutions for all GAN coding exercises.
- **`README.md`** → This file! Overview of the project and how to use the materials.

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn

✅ How GANs generate images from noise.  
✅ The battle between **Generator** and **Discriminator**.  
✅ Training GANs with real datasets (like MNIST & CelebA).  
✅ Implementing **Style Transfer**, **Anime Face Generation**, **Text-to-Image GANs**, and more!  

## 🚀 Getting Started

1️⃣ Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/GAN-Challenges.git
cd GAN-Challenges
```
2️⃣ Install dependencies (PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenAI CLIP, etc.):
```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib transformers
```
3️⃣ Run the exercises and explore the challenges!
```bash
python your_selected_script.py
```

## 🏆 Challenges Included

🔹 **Basic GAN Training** – Build a simple GAN and train it on MNIST.  
🔹 **Style Transfer GAN** – Apply artistic styles to images.  
🔹 **Text-to-Image GAN** – Convert text descriptions into images.  
🔹 **Anime Face Generation** – Train a GAN to create new anime characters.  
🔹 **Human Face Generation (StyleGAN2)** – Generate realistic human faces.
